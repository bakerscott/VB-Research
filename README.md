# VB-Research
Summer work for a volleyball video tracking project with Dr. David Knox at University of Colorado, Boulder

# Contributors:
* Crossland Beer
* Scott Baker

# Folders:
* Jupyter
* Python

# Goals:
* Write a paper
* Learn/master GitHub
* Gain experience in Jupyter, Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow(?), Teletype Atom, etc.

# Action Items:
* OpenCV book
* (c) update Jupter Notebook with OpenCV packages --- git commit practice
* Read all of the articles in the folder
* (s) get old code "running"/understood
* create a "summer Requirements and Questions proposal" --- due Friday 1pm Knox  
* (s) calendar with "work hours" and schedule and share it
* (s) "dig" for more articles (max 1 hr)


# Notes:

## Questions:
* What elements of previous work can be used?
* What aspects of court/pixel size and relationship can we use for distances?
  * Can information about the court be used to find distances?
* What tracking are we able to do given a certain piece of hardware?
* What angles are "appropriate" for taking video of players?
* Can we use this to build and track volleyball images?
* (ultimate) Can we create a 3D model of a "hit/play/game"?

## Requirements:
* Some way to measure distance from camera to ball / players
* Know how high the player jumps
* Know how fast the player hits the volleyball
* Know the trajectory of the ball in flight


### Tracking:
* Centimeter accuracy of volleyball size and movement
* Given: specific angle and camera used

### Application:
second part of the project---application to recruiting and practical player evaluation
